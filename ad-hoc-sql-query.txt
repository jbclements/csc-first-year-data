/* =====================================================================================================
   Purpose:
        Computer Science Program would like information on students who were ever in the Majors of
           Computer Engineering, Computer Science and Software Engineering Between 2005 and 2016
           to analyze their grade in CPE 101, CPE 102, CPE 103 and CPE 123.

   Include score for CSC AP Test #31.

   Exclude deceased students.
