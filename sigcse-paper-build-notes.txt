To build data for paper (2017-12-05):

1) run "rebuild-databases.rkt" to build tables
2) run "instructor-outcomes.rkt" to build more tables
3) run "instructor-analysis.rkt" with different filter selections
4) For each filter selection, use R with
foo = read.csv('/tmp/grade-table.csv')
... and then run plot(foo)

... oh but what about the other racket plots? Sigh. Not sure right now.
